### General

1. [The NSynth Dataset](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/nsynth)
<br>NSynth is an audio dataset containing 305,979 musical notes, each with a unique pitch, timbre, and envelope. For 1,006 instruments from commercial sample libraries, we generated four second, monophonic 16kHz audio snippets, referred to as notes, by ranging over every pitch of a standard MIDI pian o (21-108) as well as five different velocities (25, 50, 75, 100, 127). The note was held for the first three seconds and allowed to decay for the final second.
