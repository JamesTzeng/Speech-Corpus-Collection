# Speech-Corpus-Collection

This repo is a collection of Speech Corpus for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS). 

### ASR Corpus

1. [VCTK](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jyamagis/page3/page58/page58.html)
<br>Around 10.4GB. [Alternative Host](http://www.udialogue.org/download/cstr-vctk-corpus.html)

### TTS Corpus

1. [CMU ARCTIC Databases](http://festvox.org/cmu_arctic/)
<br>The databases consist of around 1150 utterances, including US English male (bdl) and female (slt) speakers, as well as other accented speakers.

2. [The World English Bible](http://www.audiotreasure.com/webindex.htm)
The World English Bible is a public domain update of the American Standard Version of 1901 into modern English. Its text and audio recordings are freely avaiable [here](http://www.audiotreasure.com/webindex.htm). Unfortunately, however, each of the audio files matches a chapter, not a verse, so is too long in most cases. [Kyubyong](https://github.com/Kyubyong/tacotron) sliced them by verse manually. You can get them on his [dropbox](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/42868014/WEB.zip).

### General

1. [The NSynth Dataset](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/nsynth)
<br>NSynth is an audio dataset containing 305,979 musical notes, each with a unique pitch, timbre, and envelope. For 1,006 instruments from commercial sample libraries, we generated four second, monophonic 16kHz audio snippets, referred to as notes, by ranging over every pitch of a standard MIDI pian o (21-108) as well as five different velocities (25, 50, 75, 100, 127). The note was held for the first three seconds and allowed to decay for the final second.
